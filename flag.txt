CONGRATULATIONS! 

You've found the hidden flag: BlackCat{Purr3ct_St0rag3_3num3r4t10n}

HINT FOR THE NEXT EXERCISE:
-------------------------------------

Now that you've mastered basic storage account enumeration, try the following:

1. Look for SAS tokens in the JavaScript files of the $web container
2. Check if there are any other storage accounts with similar naming patterns
3. Try to find any connection strings in KeyVault that might lead to additional storage accounts

Remember: Sometimes the most valuable information is hidden in plain sight, like embedded credentials in source code or configuration files.

Good hunting!
